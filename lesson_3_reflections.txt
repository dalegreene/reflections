Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: This would be done when you would like to share your work with others.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: It would be best to manually pull changes rather than automatically because someone else who may have edited your work on the remote repository could have done something you wouldn't want on your local repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Branches are different versions linking to one commit (mainly linked to master), clones are copies of a repository on a local network, and forks are clones within GitHub.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: The benefit is so that if there are any unwanted changes pulled from GitHub then you always have the original one stored.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: Collaboration could be done without GitHub by eyeballing your counterpart's work face-to-face instead.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: One would want to make changes in a separate branch if a trial and error portion is to be added to the project.
